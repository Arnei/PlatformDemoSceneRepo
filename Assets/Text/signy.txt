Howdy! Im Signy, Signy the sign!
And who are you?
...
......
Not the most talkative one, are we?
Oh well,
I guess I should teach you about controls anyways.
You can press 'Space' to jump high. Hold the button to gain even more height!
Hold 'Shift' to go really fast (But not too fast).
Use 'Y' to detach your little friend there. You can also reattach him to you,
but only if he's close by.
Even when you are apart, you can use 'X' to switch views between you and him.
And that is it!
